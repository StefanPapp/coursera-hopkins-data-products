#Developing Data Products Project - LEGO Sets  
With this The Lego Set Explorer, we visualize LEGO Sets. The LEGO Set consists of Lego pieces until 2016.

The dataset is from [Rebrickable.com](http://rebrickable.com/). It contains the basic information of each set (set id, year, number of pieces, theme, set name).  

The project is on Shiny User Showcase page (Shiny Apps with popular appeal): https://gallery.shinyapps.io/lego-viz.
